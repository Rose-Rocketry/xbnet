# XBee Networking Tools

This package is for doing fantastic things with your XBee device.  You can, of course, already use it as a serial replacement, so you can run PPP and UUCP across it.

With xbnet, you can also run Ethernet across it.  Or TCP/IP (IPv4 and IPv6).  SPX if you want?  I guess so.

This is tested with the XBee SX modules, but ought to work with any modern XBee module.

This is a followup to, and fork of, my [lorapipe](https://github.com/jgoerzen/lorapipe) project, which is something similar for LoRA radios.
